## [fit] ASR DEI Hiring Principles

^ ASR's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion committee finalized a set of Principles meant to improve our hiring process

---

## Why Principles and not Practices?

^ In the past, the committee had delivered a toolkit and practices to follow.

^ But practices can go out of date.

---

## Principles can guide

^ Practices are important, but the committee wanted a high level set of 'values' that we could set as a north star.

---

## [fit] Thanks

- Members past and present of the ASR DEI Committee
- Christina Yoong for developing the CARE acronym 

^ I joined the committee fairly late in this process. Much of the work here was done by current and previous committee members.

^ Christina Yoong developed the CARE acronym

^ We happened to be hiring while these were being finalized, so I was able to both offer specific feedback but also try to have my team follow these principles.

---

## Hiring, not retention

^ Improving your hiring process is useful, but if you hire folks that leave right away then nothing has changed 

^ That said, this work was focused on hiring so that's what I'm going to talk about today.

# The Principles

## Hiring Diverse Teams Takes Time and Intentionality

- **C**ommitment
- **A**ccountability
- **R**epresentation
- **E**mpathy

## Let's dig in deeper

# [fit] Hiring Diverse Teams Takes<br >Time and Intentionality

^ Basically, this sums everything up. You have to want to do the work and then you have to do the work.

---

# CARE

- **C**ommitment
- **A**ccountability
- **R**epresentation
- **E**mpathy

---

# Commitment

- Recognize the importance of diversity hiring
- Dedicate time to include DEI hiring principles and practices in your process.

---

# It's important!

[.footer: CARE > Commitment > Recognize the importance of diversity]

^ While I've been with the ASR Custom Solutions team
^ We've continuously worked on improving our hiring process to make it more open and equitable
^ The diverse skills, backgrounds and identities on our team are a big reason for our success and satisfaction

# Make hiring the team's job
## Before and After the person is hired

^ Early on when trying to hire I figured that it was my job, so I tried to do everything
^ This led to bad results. I don't have the time 
^ I started having team members lead parts of our interview process.
^ This allowed each lead to focus on one part.

^ And I made it clear that this was their 'job' for the duration of the hire
^ Did that mean we did less development? Yes.
^ I tried to communicate that to my managers and the stake holders affected by the slow down.

^ The time starts well before we talk to any candidates
^ - Researching groups to send our job posting to
^ - Building relationships
^ - Reviewing and rewriting questions

^ And it goes well past the time a person is hired
^ - retrospectives
^ - Action items

^ Overall I'd say a hiring process takes us 3-4 months

# Accountability

- Acknowledge biases and implement plans to mitigate them
- Provide transparency to candidates about the position, process, and communication
- Reflect on the hiring process and utilize measurable goals for improvements

---

[.footer: CARE > Accountability > Acknowledge Biases]

[.column]

# Easy (ish)

- Reduce requirements to a bare minimum
- Don't use homework assignments that bias towards candidates w/o kids, obligations
- Focus job posting on higher-level values, not technical skills

[.column]

# Harder

- Resume formatting
- Cover letters
- Names

^ When I started, the team was not diverse.
^ And the hiring process that brought me in had tons of gatekeeping that would prevent the team from changing
^ - Requiring a Bachelors
^ - Preferring a Masters
^ - Homework using incredibly opaque code
^ - High, and uncommon, technical requirements

^ There were a mountain of biases, explicit and implicit, that pushed us to hire the same kind of person, people like me, over and over.

^ We've used planning and retrospection in our hiring process to try to counter these biases

^ I still find myself drawn to a snazzy resume.
^ I don't know how to solve this problem.
^ Have someone transcribe each resume to a plain format?

^ We used to have a line in our job posting:

^ > **We place a lot of value on the cover letter**.

^ In a recent conversation with Prince Sah of OIT HR, he pointed out that this is a cultural bias. Many countries and cultures don't use cover letters at all. So we dropped that text and had a great round of hiring. Some folks still sent in cover letters, but that didn't factor in to any hiring decisions.

^ We have been trained to bias on a person's name.
^ Think of jokes you've heard, in mainstream TV or movies, about stereotypical African American names or Asian names
^ What impact does that have when you get a resume from a person with a name that is not culturally familiar to you?

^ Currently we try to address this bias by being aware of it and calling it out when we see it in ourselves
^ I know some folks have tried anonymizing resumes to address this. We have not.
^ Because names are only one signifier of class and identity.
^ Colleges, fraternities/sororities, place of residence, resume formatting

# Job Posting

# Hiring Process

Once we have an applicant we focus on honest, transparent communication

- When a round will start
- Why there is a delay
- What the next interview will consist of
- Their status

# Retrospectives and Metrics

- End of hiring retrospective
- Get diversity metrics from HR
- Review the things you tried, evidence of them working or not

[.footer: CARE > Representation]

# Representation

- Focus on inclusion over exclusion
- Form hiring committees with staff from various backgrounds
- Recruit and select from a diverse candidate pool

---

[.footer: CARE > Representation > Inclusion over Exclusion]

- Give every candidate every opportunity to succeed
- Offer as much info as you can up front
- Clear goals

^ Current IT hiring practices focuses on weird puzzles, arcane algorithm whiteboarding and a series of gates

^ It's exclusionary. If you're the last one standing after a series of trials, you get a job!

^ In our coding interview we state and restate that working code is not the goal, that this is not a puzzle to solve.
^ The interview is to emulate something the team does all the time, talk through existing code and discuss changes.

^ We try to not exclude those with kids, or with limited time, by taking up their entire weekend.

--- 

[.footer: CARE > Representation > Diverse Hiring Committees]

# Reflect who the candidate will be working with

^ My team is small enough that we are all involved in hiring committees
^ But the team also works with folks from other groups
^ So we try to bring representatives from those groups in

---

[.footer: CARE > Representation > Diverse Hiring Committees]

# [fit] Honestly reflect your diversity

^ So, there's obviously a value in having committees show the diversity your department currently has
^ 
^ If you have a team with low diversity then you are going to be asking those few diverse members of your team to be on every hiring committee
^ And that's exhausting
^ And tokenizing
^ So ask them if they want to be involved, and how
^ Don't make them the poster child to paper over your department's diversity problem

---

[.footer: CARE > Representation > Diverse Recruiting]

# Recruitment Options

- Personal networks
- Professional networks
- Paid networks

^ The first two take time to cultivate. 
^ Realize that your personal network probably mirrors your identity, so may lead to more candidates that similar to you
^ Time and effort here help.
^ Folks are less likely to respond to some rando, but they may respond better to a posting from
^ - Someone involved in the community
^ - Someone who has proven that they are doing the work

^ We have not used paid networks, but I can see us doing that in the future.

# Empathy

- Give the candidates every opportunity to succeed.
- Remove barriers to the hiring process.
- Provide a welcoming environment for all candidates.

# Include, don't exclude

^ This is a mirror of the "include, don't exclude" principal
^ People like succeeding, not failing
^ When people are working on my team I want them to be successful that starts before they join
^ Provide questions in advance, explain exactly what you're looking for
